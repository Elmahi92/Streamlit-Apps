## Overview

This project dives into the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) dataset, which is used to monitor armed conflicts worldwide. By utilizing the ACLED direct API, we built an up-to-date analytics tool specifically for tracking the ongoing conflict in Sudan. The tool highlights recent developments, as well as news and reports from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

### Key Features
- Real-time data retrieval using the ACLED API
- Focus on the ongoing conflict in Sudan
- Integration of OCHA reports to provide context and highlight humanitarian updates
- Visualizations to track conflict events over time

## Data Sources
- **ACLED API**: For live conflict event data
- **OCHA Reports**: To provide humanitarian updates and recent news
